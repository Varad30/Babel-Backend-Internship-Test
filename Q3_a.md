API- Application Programming Interface. it is the medium by which different software interact.
it works as a as a facilitator connecting software platforms that would otherwise not be able to interact.
i mainly use google authenticator api for two factor authentication method as also it saves a lot of time otherwise we need to enter all the details manually.
